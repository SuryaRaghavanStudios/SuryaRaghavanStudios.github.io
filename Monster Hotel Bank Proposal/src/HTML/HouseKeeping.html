      <h1><em>HouseKeeping</em></h1>
      <p>
        The first thing that we are going to talk about is what the housekeepers
        need to do when a family just finished their stay and went away. this is
        what they are going to do:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Replace the towels</li>
        <li>Washing the Sheets</li>
        <li>Vaccuum</li>
        <li>Check TV and clear out all accounts</li>
        <li>Sanitize</li>
        <li>Make sure if the family left something behind</li>
        <li>Dust Furniture</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Next we are going to talk about is how many housekeepers I am going to
        put on each floor.
      </p>
      <p>There is going to be 13 floors and 87 rooms.</p>
      <p>The total housekeepers I can have is 60.</p>
      <p>
        So, this is how much housekeepers there is going to be on each floor:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>2nd floor: 5 housekeepers</li>
        <li>3rd floor: 5 housekeepers</li>
        <li>4th floor: 5 housekeepers</li>
        <li>5th floor: 6 housekeepers</li>
        <li>6th floor: 4 housekeepers</li>
        <li>7th floor: 6 housekeepers</li>
        <li>8th floor: 7 housekeepers</li>
        <li>9th Floor: 7 housekeepers</li>
        <li>10th Floor: 5 housekeepers</li>
        <li>11th Floor: 5 housekeepers</li>
        <li>12th Floor: 2 housekeepers</li>
        <li>13th Floor: 3 housekeepers</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The reason why I chose to put this many housekeepers on each floor is
        because it depends on how many rooms there are on each floor.
