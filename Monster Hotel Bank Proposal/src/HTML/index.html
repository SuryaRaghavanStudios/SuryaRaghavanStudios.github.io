        Hello, Banker, to my Monster Hotel Bank Proposal!
      </p>
      <p>
        Today I am here to propose to get money to start a business. That
        business is starting a hotel just for monsters! I want the hotel to be
        near a <b>beach.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        So the theme of the hotel is relaxation. The name is going to be
        <em>Grand Luxury Resort</em>. The logo is going to look like this:
        <br />
        <a href="../img/MHBP_Logo.jpg" target="_blank"
          ><img src="../img/MHBP_Logo.jpg" alt="Logo" width="250"
        /></a>
      </p>
      <p>Did you notice it was a pi sign?</p>
      <p>
        I have built a model of the building using legos and here is the final:
        <br />
        <a href="../img/Building.png" target="_blank"
          ><img src="../img/Building.png" alt="Building" width="250"
        /></a>
      </p>

      <p>
        The building is on the left and on the right you might see something
        like a pad on legs. That is the Helicopter pad!
      </p>
      <p>
        The exciting and epic thing in my hotel is that there are going to be
        activities to do there, to keep the monsters occupied and come back here
        to the hotel. The three activities are the <em>The Super Swing</em>,
        <em>The Water Surge</em>, and <em>The Arcade</em>. Here are the links to
        navigate for information about the activities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <div id="activities">
        <h2>Activities:</h2>
        <br />
        <br />
        <a href="./super-swing.html">
          <button id="super-swing"><em>The Super Swing</em></button>
        </a>
        <a href="./water-surge.html">
          <button id="water-surge"><em>The Water Surge</em></button>
        </a>
        <a href="./arcade.html">
          <button id="arcade"><em>The Arcade</em></button>
        </a>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </div>
      <p>
        There is also going to be a Jr. Monster Section! Please go to this page
        to read about it:
      </p>

        ><button>Jr. Monster Section</button></a
      >
      <p>

        button to go to that page:
      </p>
      <a href="./HouseKeeping.html"><button>HouseKeeping</button></a>
      <p>
        The next we are going to talk about is the rooms! there are 4 types of
        rooms. I only did the blueprints for the normal rooms which are the
        <em>Standard Monster Room</em> and the
        <em>Deluxe Relaxy Presedential Suite</em>. Pease click this button to
        navigate to those pages:

      <a href="./blueprints.html"
        ><button>Blueprints For The Rooms</button></a
      >
      <p>
        The next thing we are going to talk about is what the Kids should do in
        the hotel. There is going to be an Arts & Crafts section, a library for
        the kids, and all that stuff. Please navigate to this page for examples
        on what the arts & crafts might look like:
      </p>
      <a href="./art_samples.html"><button>Art Samples</button></a>
      <p>
        If you are wondering how I can fit all this stuff in a small building is
        because it is going to be Magic! Yes, yes, yes, magic is real. All you
        got to do is believe! So yeah! I just have to imagine a small building
        with a bunch of space and poof ðŸ’¥ it just appeared!
      </p>
      <p>
        The next thing that we are going to talk about is what the for should
        look like for employees applying for the job. Please navigate to this
        page to view the information:
      </p>
      <a href="./Job_Application.html"><button>Job Application Form</button></a>
      <p>
        The next thing we are going to talk about is how to let people know that
        my hotel even <b>exists</b>. So thing that I figured out is that I could
        invite special guests and people will follow them and be like like,
        "Wow, there's a new hotel this (Special Guests' Name) is going to!" and
        stuff like that. So the people will follow, find out about my hotel, and
        come in and live there.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last thing we are going to talk about is what we are going to feed
        the monsters if they are hungry. Please navigate to this page to be
        informed about it:
