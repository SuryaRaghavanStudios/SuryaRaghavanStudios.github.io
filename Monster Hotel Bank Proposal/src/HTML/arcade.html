      <h1><em>The Arcade</em></h1>
      <p>
        You can play videogames in <em>The Arcade</em>! The monsters will like
        this because they're near technology and everybody loves technology!
        This is how it is going to look like:
      </p>
      <a href="../img/Activities Images/The Arcade.png" target="_blank"
        ><img
          src="../img/Activities Images/The Arcade.png"
          alt="Arcade image"
          width="250"
      /></a>
      <p>Here is the original pricing plan:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For Adults: $15.00</li>
        <li>For Kids: $5.00</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In case, they stay at my hotel for more than 5 nights, the pricing plan
        goes down just for those monsters! Pricing plant in case that happens:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>For Adults: $12.00</li>
        <li>For Kids: $2.00</li>
      </ul>
