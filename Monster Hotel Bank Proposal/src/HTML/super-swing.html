      <h1><em>The Super Swing</em></h1>
      <p>
        A monster will sit on a pad strapped to a bunch of ropes that are
        strapped on a couple of high columns. And then, there will be a
        generator that swings the pad high into the air! The monsters are going
        to like this because they go into the air and they will feel the air
        going past their face and that will be fun in my opinion. I don't know
        if the monsters will like it but most likely (99.999999999 / 100% )
        will. This is how it will look like:

          ><img

            alt="Super Swing Image"
            width="250"
        /></a>
      </p>

        If the monsters stay in my hotel for more than 5 nights, than the
        pricing goes down by 2 bucks. Here is the pricing in that case:
