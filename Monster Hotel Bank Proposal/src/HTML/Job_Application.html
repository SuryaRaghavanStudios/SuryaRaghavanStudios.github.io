      <a href="../img/Job_Application.png" target="_blank"
        ><img src="../img/Job_Application.png" alt="Job Application"

      <p>This is what the form says:</p>
    </center>
    <ol>
      <li>First, you have to enter your name</li>
      <li>
        Second, you have to enter your gender and there are three options:
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>Male</li>
          <li>Female</li>
          <li>Other</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Third, you have to enter your signature.</li>
      <li>Fourth, you have to enter when you were born</li>
      <li>Fifth, where you live</li>
      <li>
        And Sixth, whether or not you have criminal records. This one is
        important because if the monster circle 'YES' than I don't accept them
        for the job.
      </li>
      <li>Seventh, whether or not you went to school.</li>
      <li>Eight (Also, the last), whether or not you have parents.</li>
