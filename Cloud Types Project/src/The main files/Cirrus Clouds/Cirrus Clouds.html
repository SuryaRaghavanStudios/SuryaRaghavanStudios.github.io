    <p>Cirrus clouds are the most common of the high clouds. They are composed of ice and are thin, wispy clouds blown in high
    winds into long streamers. Cirrus clouds are usually white and predict fair to pleasant weather. By watching the
    movement of cirrus clouds you can tell from which direction weather is approaching. When you see cirrus clouds, it
    usually indicates that a change in the weather will occur within 24 hours.</p>
