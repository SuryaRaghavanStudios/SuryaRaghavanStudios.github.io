    <p>Anvil clouds, which are mostly composed of ice particles, form in the upper parts of thunderstorms. They get their anvil
    shape from the fact that the rising air in thunderstorms expands and spreads out as the air bumps up against the bottom
    of the stratosphere. This is because the air in the stratosphere is warmer than the rising air in the anvil, and so
    prevents the relatively cooler anvil air from rising any farther.</p>
