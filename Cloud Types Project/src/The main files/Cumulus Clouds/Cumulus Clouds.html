    <p>Cumulus clouds are white, puffy clouds that look like pieces of floating cotton. Cumulus clouds are often called
    “fair-weather clouds”. The base of each cloud is flat and the top of each cloud has rounded towers. When the top of the
    cumulus clouds resemble the head of a cauliflower, it is called cumulus congestus or towering cumulus. These clouds grow
    upward and they can develop into giant cumulonimbus clouds, which are thunderstorm clouds.</p>
