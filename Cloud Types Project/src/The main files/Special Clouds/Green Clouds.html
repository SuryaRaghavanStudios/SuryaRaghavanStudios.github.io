    <p>Green Clouds are often associated with severe weather. The green color is not completely understood, but it is thought
    to have something to do with having a high amount of liquid water drops and hail inside the clouds. In the Great Plains
    region of the U.S. green clouds are associated with storms likely to produce hail and tornadoes.</p>
