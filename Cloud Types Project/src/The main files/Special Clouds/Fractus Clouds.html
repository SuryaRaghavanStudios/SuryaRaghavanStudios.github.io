    <p>Fractus clouds are small, ragged cloud fragments that are usually found under an ambient cloud base. They form or have
    broken off from a larger cloud, and are generally sheared by strong winds, giving them a jagged, shredded appearance.
    Fractus have irregular patterns, appearing much like torn pieces of cotton candy. They change constantly, often forming
    and dissipating rapidly. They do not have clearly defined bases. Sometimes they are persistent and form very near the
    surface.</p>
